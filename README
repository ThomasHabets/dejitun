Install
=======
Just type "make", and then put the binary (dejitun) whereever you like.

How it works
============
FIXME: will fill this in.

Running
=======
Creating tunnels require root access.

Start dejitun on both hosts::
 # ./dejitun -d 1 -l <port on local host> <ip of peer> <port on peer>
(where 1 here is the minimum delay to induce)

Set up link network on both hosts::
 # ifconfig dejitun0 192.168.5.1 pointopoint 192.168.5.2
